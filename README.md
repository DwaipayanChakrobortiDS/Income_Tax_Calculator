Streamlit app: The web interface created using Streamlit.

Here's a brief overview of the code:

import streamlit as st

def calculate_tax(salary, deductions):
    # Define the income tax slabs for the old regime
    tax_slabs = [(250000, 0.05), (500000, 0.1), (750000, 0.15), (1000000, 0.2), (1250000, 0.25), (1500000, 0.3)]

    # Calculate taxable income after deductions
    taxable_income = salary - deductions

    # Initialize tax amount
    tax_amount = 0

    # Calculate tax based on slabs
    for slab_limit, slab_rate in tax_slabs:
        if taxable_income <= slab_limit:
            tax_amount += taxable_income * slab_rate
            break
        else:
            tax_amount += slab_limit * slab_rate
            taxable_income -= slab_limit

    return tax_amount
